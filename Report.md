# Healthcare Seeking Behavior for respiratory disease paper review
---

# Introduction
- The paper focuses on acute respiratory illnesses and severe pneumonia and reveals that most people do not seek formal healthcare due to financial constraints, social economic status, and distance from healthcare facilities.
- The lack of healthcare seeking behavior leads to an underestimation of the disease burden of respiratory illnesses in the population.

---
# Methodology Overview
- The study sites include Nakuru, Kakamega, Marsabit
- The study design was a cross-sectional study with a two-stage cluster sampling procedure, randomly selecting sub-locations and households.
- The study included households with children under five years old, using a structured survey instrument for data collection.
- The data was stored in a password-protected database, and statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 15.1 version software.Key Findings and Discussion
- Only 40% of people with acute respiratory illnesses and 74% with severe pneumonia sought healthcare.
- Only 21% of severe pneumonia cases were hospitalized, despite more needing it, and children under five and wealthier households were more likely to seek formal care.
- Self-medication from pharmacies was common, with rates of 21-28%, and hospital-based surveillance missed over 75% of severe pneumonia cases in the community.

# Detailed Findings and Risk Factors
- The study found that 52.9% of infections were female, 25.9% were children under five,and 1.6% were elderly people.
- Social status and education level were significant risk factors, with wealthier households and better-educated individuals more likely to seek healthcare.
- High cost of healthcare and limited hospital bed capacity were major barriers to hospitalization, especially in rural areas.

---
# Conclusion
- There is need to address financial barriers and improve hospital capacity.
- The team plans to continue working on the paper and other initiatives to improve
community engagement and healthcare seeking behavior.
- The discussion highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to address the challenges faced in healthcare seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses in Kenya.
- The meeting concludes with a commitment to move forward with the proposed strategies and collaborations to achieve the team's objectives.
