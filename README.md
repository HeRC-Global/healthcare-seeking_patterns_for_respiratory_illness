# Healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses in Kenya: implications for burden of disease estimation Review
---
## Background
This paper advocates for robust Understanding of healthcare-seeking patterns for respiratory illness that can help improve estimation of disease burden and target public health interventions to control acute respiratory disease in Kenya.

## Methods used
 a cross-sectional survey was carried out to determine healthcare utilization patterns for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and severe pneumonia in four diverse counties representing urban, peri-urban, rural mixed farmers, and rural pastoralist communities in Kenya using a two-stage (sub-locations then households) cluster sampling procedure. Healthcare seeking behavior for ARI episodes in the last 14 days, and severe pneumonia in the last 12 months was evaluated. Severe pneumonia was defined as reported cough and difficulty breathing for > 2 days and report of hospitalization or recommendation for hospitalization, or a danger sign (unable to breastfeed/drink, vomiting everything, convulsions, unconscious) for children < 5 years, or report of inability to perform routine chores.

 ## Results
 From August through September 2018, 28,072 individuals were interviewed from 5,407 households. Of those surveyed, 9.2% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 7.9–10.7) reported an episode of ARI, and 4.2% (95% CI 3.8–4.6) reported an episode of severe pneumonia. Of the reported ARI cases, 40.0% (95% CI 36.8–43.3) sought care at a health facility. Of the74.2% (95% CI 70.2–77.9) who reported severe pneumonia and visited a medical health facility, 28.9% (95% CI 25.6–32.6) were hospitalized and 7.0% (95% CI 5.4–9.1) were referred by a clinician to the hospital but not hospitalized. 21% (95% CI 18.2–23.6) of self-reported severe pneumonias were hospitalized. Children aged < 5 years and persons in households with a higher socio-economic status were more likely to seek care for respiratory illness at a health facility.

 ## Conclusion
Findings suggest that hospital-based surveillance captures less than one quarter of severe pneumonia in the community. Multipliers from community household surveys can account for underutilization of healthcare resources and under-ascertainment of severe pneumonia at hospitals.
